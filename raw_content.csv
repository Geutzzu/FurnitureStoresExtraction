Perhaps it reminds you of that wonderful weekend away, you had in that little country pub or maybe it takes you back to visiting your grandparents when you were young. As the name suggests fireside chairs are often very evocative of nice times you've had. ### Whether you just need an extra chair in your front room, but haven't much space or you are lucky enough to have a large hallway but have nowhere to sit for a long chat to family or friends on the phone. Perhaps you need a nice leather button-backed wing chair to go in the study or maybe, when Great Aunt comes round she now finds it a little difficult to get off your sofa. ### Shannon Sales have an extensive selection of low seat chairs, high seat chairs, petite, large, fabric and leather chairs within the store, many for immediate delivery. Also if the customer is unable, through ill health to come into the store, we are quite willing to take a selection of chairs out for them to try in their own home, within a 40 mile radius and friendly helpful advice when deciding, we think that you will agree that ""Our service is second to none"". ### Shannon Sales has been family owned and run since 1970. We offer a warm, personal service and a large range of stunning furnishings. Free delivery and assembly of any of our furniture within a 40 mile radius."

Choose a source material that fits your aesthetic knowing that the Framework is designed to last a lifetime. ### • The strength and stability of your Floyd Bed Framework greatly depends on the size, thickness, weight, and type of material you select for your panel. ### • Recommended thickness for each panel: 1.5"" ### Package Details ### Package 117.5"" x 13"" x 6.5"" and weighs 21 lb. ### Powder Coated Steel ### 11-gauge bent sheet steel, matte-coated for longevity. ### Nylon Ratchet Straps ### These squeeze everything in place and ensure your Floyd Bed Framework is not going anywhere. ### Choosing Your Surface ### The strength and stability of your Floyd Bed Framework greatly depends on the size, thickness, weight, and type of material you select for your panel. The simplest, most cost-effective panels can be made from plywood, however, there are plenty of other options! More info on what we do (and do not) recommend when sourcing your panels can be found in our FAQ here. ### Min. Recommended Length (for each panel)86"" ### Max. Recommended Width (for each panel)30"" ### Recommended Thickness (for each panel)1.5"" ### To achieve the required thickness, consider laminating two 0.75"" thick plywood together. ### The Twin Bed Framework requires 2 panels. ### The Full/Queen Bed Framework requires 3 panels. ### A King or California King Framework requires 4 panels. ### Cobalt ### Most flat-packed bed frames come together with 100s of parts, pegs and screws - connections that loosen and break down over time. On average they last just two moves before they’re tossed to the curb. The minimal design of The Floyd Bed Frame uses none of these parts (or tools). It was intentionally created for move-ability and a lifetime of use. That’s why we call it Furniture For Keeping.Quality materials like powder coated steel supports give you the building blocks to bring great design in your space, that's easy to assemble and easy to move with you. Just source your own panels, and call it a night. ### Available in 3 wood types ### Starting at

For more information, go to www.P65Warnings.ca.gov. ### Why are there price differences between the different Table surface materials? ### The prices of the birch and walnut tables reflect the higher cost of their respective veneers, as well as the more intricate manufacturing process for this type of surface. Each table features the same steel legs and we know any of them will look beautiful in your space. ### Is there anything I shouldn't put on The Table? ### For best protection, use a coaster when placing drinks or hot items on The Table. Be careful when putting potted plants directly on the surface! We recommend placing a drainage tray with a coaster or trivet under any plants. Additionally, for our walnut and birch surfaces, we advise against placing any seasonal vegetables (we’re looking at you festive pumpkins) directly on the Table. ### Can I paint or stain my table? ### Altering your Table, whether it be the color, finish, height or something else, goes against our recommended use and therefore voids the warranty. ### Anthracite ### When we set out to design The Floyd Table Collection, we started in the Netherlands, with a 90-year-old manufacturer of linoleum.This misunderstood, all-natural material starts with pressed linseeds and pinesap. Once this mixture reaches the right consistency. It’s then combined with wood flour, finely ground limestone, and vivid color creating a firm, dry mixture. The mixture is then calendared into sheets and pressed onto a jute backing pressed. It takes 14-20 days to dry, then receives a finishing treatment that is UV cured & protects the material for life. It’s soft to the touch, but incredible durable making it the perfect finish to a surface that you’ll use every day! ### Available in 5 colors ### Starting at

Once this mixture reaches the right consistency. It’s then combined with wood flour, finely ground limestone, and vivid color creating a firm, dry mixture. The mixture is then calendared into sheets and pressed onto a jute backing pressed. It takes 14-20 days to dry, then receives a finishing treatment that is UV cured & protects the material for life. It’s soft to the touch, but incredible durable making it the perfect finish to a surface that you’ll use every day! ### Available in 14 colors ### Starting at

The measurements in terms of sitting height were perfect and I will only buy a lounge that has stitched in back and seat cushions as I hate having to rearrange cushions after sitting on a lounge. Even though there were literally dozens of fabric colour options we love the display colour which is light grey and it wasn't hard to brighten up with some blue cushions. The chaise is really good how it tapers to the side. The price was fine so that is why we are up to our second one from this range.

Our harness leather is a classic leather that will age beautifully over time. We celebrate the living finish of our leather and its inherent imperfections. Each piece of leather has a history, scratches, dents, folds, and marks that are naturally in the leather, is something that we embrace and repurpose. We do not view these marks as defects. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each item. The patina created by daily wear-and-tear is meant to change and evolve over time. ### Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times. ### We are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on ourReady to Shippage. ### The plug in Ava Wall Sconce can be either UL or CE certified.

Our harness leather is a classic leather that will age beautifully over time. We celebrate the living finish of our leather and its inherent imperfections. Each piece of leather has a history, scratches, dents, folds, and marks that are naturally in the leather, is something that we embrace and repurpose. We do not view these marks as defects. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each item. The patina created by daily wear-and-tear is meant to change and evolve over time. ### Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times. ### We are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on ourReady to Shippage. ### The hardwired Ava wall sconce comes with a UL sticker and is UL certified. Pleasecontact usdirectly for CE requirements. ### The Edmund Pendant is not damp rated, and not recommended for bathrooms that experience high humidity or condensation without proper ventilation. ### We offer trade services to interior designers, decorators and architects.

The chair is made in the colour antique, which is cozy and suitable for every occasion. The seat is made of rattan poles binded on a frame of rattan performed by skilled wicker makers. Salsa is a barstool with a footrest and a comfortably curved seat. The rattan barstool can be used at the bar or in an open plan kitchen to offer just the right atmosphere. It is also suitable for hotel bars and restaurants. The bar chair is designed by Sika Design, which is located on Fyn near Rynkeby. ### Width:46 cm | 18.2 inches * ### Depth:40 cm | 15.8 inches * ### Height:79 cm | 31.2 inches * ### Seat height:76 cm | 30 inches * ### Weight:5 kg | 11.1 lbs * ### * Measurements & weight displayed do not include any selected add-on ### This furniture is handcrafted in rattan, which is one of the most sustainable materials available for furniture manufacturing. Rattan is often confused with bamboo, but unlike hollow bamboo, rattan is a solid material.  This makes rattan furniture very durable, and able to last for generations. ### When steamed for 10-15 minutes, rattan can be formed by hand using old traditional manufacturing techniques and a few simple tools.

And neither does Arne Jacobsen's beautiful and timeless Cylinda-Line, so this must be the perfect match for your marriage. Arne Jacobsen's Cylinda-Line in stainless steel is the essence of functional design, which is before its time - and world class design. With this coffee maker Stelton is introducing the most elegant press coffee maker on the market. It is good news to everyone who loves properly prepared coffee and the beautiful, classic Stelton design. ### The press coffee maker is double-walled to keep in the heat so both the taste and the temperature are perfect once the coffee has drawn and the plunger depressed. The sugar bowl and creamer goes wonderfully with the rest of the line or can easily stand on its own as a classic design. ### Material: 18/8 Stainless Steel. ### Choose from the coffee press, sugar bowl or creamer. ### Dimensions: ### Sugar Bowl: 3"" x 2.25"", Capacity: 6.75 oz ### Creamer : 2"" x 3.75"", Capacity: 5 oz ### Coffee Press: 6.25"" x 8"", Capacity: 8 cups ### Stelton was founded in 1960 and the foundation for future success was laid in 1964 when Peter Holmblad, Stelton’s managing director, established collaboration with the leading Danish architect and designer Arne Jacobsen. The result, the now famous Cylinda-Line tableware range, was launched in 1967. ### Cylinda-Line immediately attracted considerable attention because of its serene and functional design. In 1971, the company brought on designer Erik Magnussen. His first creation for Stelton, the stainless steel vacuum jug with a unique rocker stopper, was introduced in 1977 – the best-selling product to date for the company. ### Rooted in Scandinavian design tradition, the company seeks to continue its’ position as a leading design house with the most innovative, trend-setting design. ### Huset, “the house” in Swedish, Danish and Norwegian, is a one-stop shop for the best in modern Scandinavian design.

Icon of timeless contemporaneity and one of the most effective expressions of Made in Italy excellence combining research and creative flair, Le Bambole have provided a very personal answer to the theme of seats. What makes them special is the apparent absence of a load bearing structure, the extreme naturalness of the shape, and the combination of comfort, softness and elasticity that their appearance conveys.

A sustainable project thanks to the choice of materials and the construction method, that allows the components of Le Bambole to be completely disassembled and therefore easily recyclable. ### Technical Information: ### Upholstery:flexible cold shaped polyurethane foam, polyester fiber cover ### Elastic section:thermoplastic elastomer or expanded polyurethane ### Frame:polyethylene ### Feet cover:nylon ### Ferrules:thermoplastic material ### Cover:fabric or leather ### Please call for showroom for more details ### Vendor:B&B Italia ### Sign up to get the latest on sales, new releases and more. ### © 2016 SoftSquare - All Rights Reserved941.554.4068 ### Please Wait..."

Very comfortable. Well worth the price! Very sturdy base as well! ### After searching for this recliner and ottoman locally here in California I found it on Q/W Furniture's website halfway across the country.  It was on sale for considerably less than local pricing and it was immediately available from their supplier's warehouse.  I would have purchased locally but I needed delivery by the end of January to coincide with recovery from shoulder replacement surgery. I spoke with their customer support people several times, placed the order and it was delivered in perfect condition other than having to assemble the two items.  Assembly went smoothly and its an extremely comfortable chair.  I spent many days in it during my initial recovery which made it very bearable.  This was a very satisfactory purchasing experience and I would be pleased to do business with Q/W Furniture again in the future. ### Discover Amish craftsmanship at Quality Woods Furniture in Rochester, MN.

You’ll find extra value engineered in our products like welded aluminum frames under our tables and thicker support pieces. ### Quality ### To us, quality means consistency. To the customer, this means holes line up for easy assembly, all components are hand-routed for exceptional smoothness and little details are not missed. ### Fasteners ### Our fasteners are made of chrome-plated stainless steel. Used widely in the salt-water marine industry, these fasteners resist corrosion better than typical grades of stainless steel. ### Durability ### We use welded aluminum frames under tabletops, heat-bent curved components and thicker material for support pieces. New products undergo extensive strength testing to ensure the strongest, longest-lasting furniture possible. ### Do you need assistance making  your selections?

High quality. Easy to assemble. Super customer service. ### Purchased a chair. The process was smooth and communication was good. I was kept aware of the delivery status. Would not hesitate to work with this company. ### I did a LOT of research looking for the right chair for our motorhome. There's no telling how many sites I searched. I did find a Benchmaster chair and ottoman on another site but it was covered with fake leather. This chair is just what we wanted. It's covered in leather and it feels really good and am sure we will get a longer wear life with it. It's really comfortable! I am 5'8"" and I couldn't ask for more. It came in one box - which surprised me but all was there. Went together easy enough and all the parts were there as well as instructions. This is going in our motorhome to replace an original type chair - except this one is better. Would recommend the chair and Quality Wood Furniture company! Thanks ### We are a tall family so finding a chair with a comfortable seating area is tough.

Pony has a moulded foam body, feet and ears which are all connected by a tube frame and upholstered in a stretch fabric. Pony chair was designed in 1973 by Eero Aarnio. ### We are happy to provide you fabric samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Pony. You can find our contact informationhere. ### Dimensions:110 cm width x 65 cm depth x 87 cm height ### Materials:Metal, moulded foam, fabric ### “A chair is a chair, is a chair, is a chair... but a seat does not necessarily have to be a chair. It can be anything as long as it is ergonomically correct. A seat could even be a small and soft Pony on which you can ride or sit sideways. Pony looks like a child’s oversized toy, but its dimensions are suited to adults. We are all big kids, of course.” ### In 1972 the Aarnios lived in Tontunmäki, where Eero utilized their garage as his work space. Although his previous pieces had already possessed uniqueness and characteristics, Eero describes Pony as his first very unusual design. He thought about chairs. One can sit almost anywhere. A seat doesn’t even have to be a chair or a sofa. One can sit on the stairs, on a rock, on a tree stump, on a horse, on a pony… He decided to design a soft animal figure, which you could sit on, like riding a horse. ### In 1973 the first sketch of the Pony was sent to Asko Furniture company, who was the main producer of Eero Aarnio’s designs. They completed the basic form for the seat and sent it by bus to Puumala, where Eero continued developing the prototype at the Aarnio family’s summer cottage. Eero thought the first mold was decent but needed enhancing. In the country side, there was plenty of space to work, and since the body was made of polystyrene, he didn’t mind getting his hands and surroundings all over it. Eero bought some modeling clay and worked further with the body. After the basic form was finished, he painted the first Pony white. ### From the start Eero knew the Pony needed upholstering. The process for the upholsterer is extremely challenging and difficult, requiring rare talent in hand crafting. As a result, one can only admire the magnificent seaming, intertwining together with the form of the body and flexibility of the fabric. However, some Ponys out there do not have their ‘furs’. Batches has been produced of concrete to serve as road blocks. Ponys made of concrete are not easily moved around, since they weigh as much as 250kg. ### Eero Aarnio’s Pony is no regular chair. The designer himself prefers to rather call it a seat. Eero designed the Pony first and foremost to provide a comfortable form. The size came out of ergonomics, it is the perfect height for back and feet to rest. One can ride it or sit sideways on it. Eero initially designed the smaller size for children, however, the young have always been as keen on to climb on the larger Pony. It looks like a child’s oversized toy, even though the dimensions are designed for adults. “We are all big kids, of course”, says Eero Aarnio. ### Pony is often referred to as intriguing the inner child in adults. Eero’s design aesthetics have a certain playfulness and humor, which have been very salient in his creativity and thinking process. Eero believes certain pieces should have a certain personality, one that suits them perfectly. For example, color is a key part of the message and a way of communicating for Eero. For the Pony, Eero prefers the colors green and white. Although, speaking from experience, for a family with children, white can be quite sensitive… ### Unioninkatu 26, 00130 Helsinki ### Mon-Wed 10-16.00 ### +358 40 559 0089 ### Eero's Story ### Footer Contact ### Footer Legal ### © 2024Eero Aarnio Originals."
https://www.aarniooriginals.com/products/mushroom,https://www.aarniooriginals.com,Mushroom ### Product details ### “My first commercial design idea was a cane stool which I wove myself in 1954” ### The Story of Mushroom,"Eero Aarnio Originals – the sole authorised manufacturer of classic designs by Eero Aarnio ### 1.913€ ### The Mushroom is one of Eero’s oldest designs and in its fibreglass form is part of the same design family that includes the Ball Chair, Pastil and Tomato. It can be used as a stool or a small table. The fibreglass Mushroom was designed in 1967 by Eero Aarnio. ### Delivery time at the moment is 6 weeks. ### Dimensions: small38 cm diameter x 23 cm height ### Dimensions: large50 cm diameter x 30 cm height ### Materials:Fibreglass ### “My first commercial design idea was a cane stool which I wove myself in 1954. It was the first version of the Mushroom. The first fibreglass samples were only produced in the 1970s, and the actual production did not start until the end of the 1990s, but as the size, dimensions and functions were the same, the name also stuck.” ### As a designer, Eero Aarnio has always been intrigued by new materials, and in 1954 he had the chance to try weaving rattan. For the first time Eero wove a basket of rattan. Turning it upside down he thought it looked like a stool. Inspired by this, Eero draught the first sketch of a rattan stool, adding a curve to the form to make it more interesting. This was the first sketch of the Mushroom. ### The first official prototype was made by the Sokeva crafts organisation in Helsinki. Eero’s basket had been loose, and he wondered whether the material would work properly for the final design of the stool. Sokeva immediately said it would be fairly straightforward to make, and so the production began. The rattan Mushroom stool was the first commercial success by Eero Aarnio, presented at the Cologne Furniture Fair in 1962. Asko Furniture company was very excited about the sales, and confident in the wide recognition the design would gain. After the fair, the stool was featured on a one-pager in the Femina magazine. In the coloured picture there was a girl sitting on the Mushroom. ### Initially, the name of the design in Finnish was “Juttujakkara”, which translates at its best as “Story stool”. Eero felt like the name depicts perfectly a setting, where a close family is gathered in front of a warm fire place. However, the name was never fluently translatable to English, and later it was renamed by an American seller as Mushroom. ### The first white fiberglass samples were only produced in the 1967, and the actual production did not start until the end of the 1990s, when other colors were also added to the collection. The Mushroom is a multifunctional furniture piece, as it works both as a stool as well as a small table. The functionality and neutral aesthetic make it a perfect addition to any interior decoration. ### Unioninkatu 26, 00130 Helsinki ### Mon-Wed 10-16.00 ### +358 40 559 0089 ### Eero's Story ### Footer Contact ### Footer Legal ### © 2024Eero Aarnio Originals."

I fell like in a bubble.
I'm very happy. ### Hello Isabelle, we are so happy to hear your dream has come true! This is all we could hope for. Thank you and we wish you all the best from Finland! ### After starting his career as a freelancer in the beginning of the 1960s, Eero Aarnio was still an unknown designer dreaming of creating a furniture piece that people would remember. He had always been fascinated by sailing boats and had familiarized himself with the new material, fiberglass. He wondered if one could exploit this material outside of the boat industry. Could he design furniture out of fiberglass? ### Eero knew that the best form for malleable plastic is curve. A closed ball could endure almost anything. He had found the most practical form for the new material he was working with. The Aarnios also needed a chair that would be large enough for all four of the family, him and his wife Pirkko, and their two daughters, to sit in together at home. Even though functionality was always his first aim, Eero Aarnio is no ordinary designer. He said to his wife: “I will make a chair that when it is put in a shop window, no one will just walk past it.” He had always loved to provoke, to cause a stir. ### Looking at the original sketch of the Ball Chair, it was created on the 11th of January in 1963. Eero immediately knew that it would have to be prototyped first. Pirkko’s father was a school teacher in Salo, where Eero spent evenings and weekends with Pirkko’s brother in the crafts class room developing the first ever shell to the Ball Chair. Taking of the molds for the first time, the outer surface turned out beautifully, but the inside was uneven and rugged. It needed to be reinforced. First, they thought of adding more fiberglass layers. The shell did in fact get stronger, but Eero realized that the weight and costs would also rise accordingly. Facing the problem, a lightbulb came on over his head. Right behind the opening of the shell, he could install a round pipe ring, and laminate it with fiberglass. The shell became as hard as stone, and it was ready to be upholstered by a talented upholsterer Kataja in Haaga. Completed in their home stood the first prototype of the Ball Chair, the very same one still present in the Aarnio family’s current home in Veikkola. ### The first potential customer for the Ball Chair was a furniture shop Sopenkorpi in Lahti. Eero showed them the drawings at the factory and told about the prototype he had made. The Ball Chair was delivered to the Helsinki, where it stood on the shop floor in Kasarmitori. The business representative came to see the chair but, in the end, they were not interested. ### Eero Aarnio didn’t lose his drive to success that easily. In 1964 he had a great idea for marketing the Coca-Cola brand. He painted the whole shell of the Ball Chair red and enlarged and glued the Coca-Cola logo to the back. He emptied their whole bedroom, bought a huge white board, and placed the Ball Chair in the center of it. He asked Pirkko to dress all black and sit in the chair and drink Coca-Cola with a straw. Eero shot a short image series, and afterwards he called the representative of Coca-Cola Finland to see if they would be interested in collaboration. When the representative saw the idea of Coca-Cola chairs he was overwhelmed by enthusiasm and wanted to send it to their company headquarters. Eero was excited, his freelancer career was about to kick off. Only it was not yet written in the stars. After a few months wait he received a fairly rude letter from the headquarters, stating that they had other plans for marketing. ### Eero still strongly believed in the Ball Chair. He had also sketched a pine shelving system, that instantly reminded him of his old employer Asko. Reaching out to Asko Eero had an ulterior motive, to pitch the idea of the Ball Chair to Asko’s representative in the fall 1965. The representative showed up with the new marketing lead, Tapani Riekkinen, both of them immediately excited by the Ball Chair. They wanted to take the new innovative piece to the Cologne Furniture Fair. Other executives were not as enthusiastic about the success of this odd shape, but due to the efforts of the marketing lead and Eero Aarnio, they managed to produce six pieces for the fair. All photography was carried out by Eero himself. Behind the six Ball Chairs was laid a huge text “Great things are coming from Asko”, and the department attracted immediate attention. ### The Ball Chair made its debut at the Cologne Furniture Fair of 1966, and the first visitors to the department were two Italians who placed orders for six Ball Chairs on the spot. During the fair the new it-product was sold to 30 countries within the week. The first piece in the Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat stated 25.11.1966: “The most exciting chair in the world is on show at the Cologne International Furniture Fair. This egg-shaped chair hides its user almost completely from view and it is also sound-proofed.” Eero wrote in his own hand in the margins of his press clip: It all began from this! Soon after, the Ball Chair was mentioned in the New York Times, followed by other media. Within a few years the Ball Chair achieved the status of an international celebrity, and decades later it can be found in the collections of design museums around the world, starring in several movies, music videos and magazine covers. ### Although, Eero Aarnio has been praised for his space-aged design and aesthetics, futurism had never been his intention when designing the Ball Chair. It was pure coincidence that the Ball Chair was created around the same time when Juri Gagarin had been the first man in space. Reflections of the cultural preoccupations of the time still remain irrelevant for the designer. To this day his favorite Ball Chair is one with a white shell and black upholstering. He fosters the feeling of seams drowning in color, like a magical substance spreading out in the chair. Sitting inside lies one’s own inner world and thoughts, a cocoon’s nest shielding from the outside noise. Futuristic? Maybe. Iconic?

According to Eero’s notes, the Bubble hangs from the ceiling because ‘there is no nice way to make a clear pedestal.’ It shares the same unique acoustics as the Ball Chair, a little cocoon that shields off the outside world. ### The hanging Bubble chair is made from acrylic and solid stainless steel, and is available in four different leather options bySørensenLeather. ### We are happy to provide you leather samples to help you decide the perfect colour for your Bubble. You can find our contact informationhere. ### Dimensions:103 cm width x 90 cm depth x 105 cm height ### Materials:Acrylic, solid stainless steel, natural leather ### “I had the idea of a transparent ball, where light comes from all directions. Acrylic can be heated and blown into shape like a soap bubble, and I knew that dome-shaped skylights were made that way. I contacted a manufacturer and asked if it would be technically possible to blow a bubble big enough for my chair. They said yes.” ### Thank you for submitting a review! ### Your input is very much appreciated. Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! ### I am soo happy with this product, really tasty ! ### I have had this chair for quite sometime and simply love it. I have the one without the stand and use the hanging chain instead. For added comfort I put a heavy duty spring on each end of the chain for that free no gravity feel Do it!! ### Hello John, thank you for your feedback, we are so happy to hear that the Bubble has found a good home with you and is bringing you joy! ### I love the free movement of the Bubble, it’s just so calming and relaxing. This is the most beautiful design chair ever, everybody always wants to try it out, it’s a showstopper and makes home instantly more luxurious. Thank you for the amazing service as well, I know that if there is ever a problem, I can always turn to you! ### Unioninkatu 26, 00130 Helsinki ### Mon-Wed 10-16.00 ### +358 40 559 0089 ### Eero's Story ### Footer Contact ### Footer Legal ### © 2024Eero Aarnio Originals."

Named after the Ariake Sea in Southern Japan, Ariake means daybreak in Japanese. It symbolizes a new chapter for the two factories as they embark on a collaboration with international designers for the global market. 
  
It is our belief that strong working relationships are the foundation of good products. Furniture is made for social situations where people live, work and eat together. The creation of the Ariake brand and furniture designs were done over two intensive workshops in Morodomi where furniture designers, art director, photographer and craftsmen did the same – we lived, worked and ate together over. Despite language barriers, the designers and craftsmen generated a collective energy and mutual trust that helped define the soul of the brand. This resulted in a collection of furniture that utilizes the best of hand and machine, inspired by the spirituality of Japanese culture and urban living contexts.
  
We present to you a 30-piece collection made from oak, ash, hinoki, cedar, leather, paper cord, cotton canvas, upholstery and unique finishes such as sumi and indigo dye. Each piece is crafted in Morodomi, with furniture designs by Anderssen & Voll, Gabriel Tan, Keiji Ashizawa, Norm Architects, Note Design Studio, Shin Azumi, Staffan Holm, Zoe Mowat, Studio MK27, Photography Sebastian Stadler, Art Direction by AnnerPerrin. ### In the spirit of reconciliation, Apato acknowledges the Traditional Custodians of Country throughout Australia and their connections to land, sea and community.

Come back when you're older. ### HM-680-237-Parkview Curio ### At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders.  Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana.  Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others.  We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made. ### Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range.  These lead times areAPPROXIMATE, they areNOT EXACT.  Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers.  These situations are beyond our control.  By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is ourbest estimate.  When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it. ### Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix.For example, item FD-3051T has an ""FD-"" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it. ### If your delivery location isoutside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extrato these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, if the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time. ### If you don't see the prefix of your item # here, please call us at480-962-9930to ask about the current production time. ### Need to expedite your order? ### We're here to help.  Call480-962-9930and we'll let you know if it is possible to get your order sooner.  A few builders offer expediting for an extra charge. ### Good news!  We now offer nation-wide delivery formostproducts (we have shipped all over the U.S.  We do not currently have a shipper to do Alaska nor Hawaii, and do not have international shipping (sorry!).We work with different shippers and they each have their own designated delivery areas of the U.S.- some areas may not be available, so please contact us to inquire about delivery to your area. ### The shopping cart will automatically calculate the type of delivery depending on the item(s) and delivery location.  Or, if you would like a delivery quote, please email us at info@oakforless.com or call our store at 480-962-9930 and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote. ### Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors.

Ariake transformed this into a milled solid wood back attached to the seat by a finger joint. “Blkest” is a Norwegian word for wind – we think of the characteristic back piece a sail or a banner waving in the wind. ### W 410 x D 465 x H 750 / SH 455 mm ### Anderssen & Voll was established in the fall of 2009.

We choose to build this chair together with the craftsmen, taking bits and pieces from different items that had character and worked towards refining the proportions and details, creating an “Outline” drawing in 1:1 which was then used to produce the prototype. It was an enjoyable and effective work process with an outcome that has both classic and modern influences. ### W 480 x D 525 x H 830 / SH 450/470 mm ### Norm Architects was founded in 2008. The multidisciplinary design studio works within the fields of industrial design, residential architecture, commercial interiors, photography and art direction. Much like human well-being, the essence of Norm Architects’ work is found in balance — between richness and restraint, order and complexity.

Each project — whether in architecture, interiors, design or creative direction — is imbued with the same intrinsic quality: a simplicity that carries bigger ideas. Guided by the body and mind rather than by trends or technology, their projects explore ideas that not only look good, but feel good too: Architecture be- comes thoughtful, minimalism acquires softness and visual matter assumes haptic qualities. Their work is sharp and crisp, and exudes, tacitly, a focus on quality, details and durability. Situated in one of the oldest streets of Copenhagen, Denmark, the studio is respectful to its context here and build on the traditions of Scandinavian de- sign — of timeless aesthetics, natural materials and upholding modernist principles of restraint and refinement. Through exploring what it is that heightens the human senses regardless of personal preference, their projects strip spaces, objects, ideas and images back to their simplest form. Their expertise lies in finding the balance — when there’s nothing more to either add nor take away. ### Ariake is a furniture brand founded by Legnatec and Hirata Chair, two factories from the furniture producing town of Morodomi in Saga prefecture, Japan.

Hand-crafted interlocking legs are both practical and design-led, whilst the sheer size of the undercarriage ensures the Florence a superior presence. ### The Florence table is hand-crafted from reclaimed Teak with a brushed finish. Teak is naturally durable and impervious to sun, rain, frost. If outdoors, the furniture will begin to acquire the beautiful silvery-grey patina that is typical of untreated teak. ### Our exclusive Florence is an extensive 2.6m long piece of furniture and can seat 10 people, making it ideal for entertaining both indoors or outdoors. Available as an indoor table, the Florence dining table has a solid top while the outdoor option has a slatted teak timber finish. ### Our Florence teak tables + benches are superior quality and are generally uniform in color, finish and hardness. That said, with teak there is always an allowance for knots or slight discoloration. Our design partners and manufacturers for the Florence range hand cut and re-fill knots in the table table top... which is time consuming + expensive, but to Living by Design's specifications.

Now you can eliminate mosquitoes and control deadly viral diseases carried by mosquitoes and other flying insects, without using harmful insecticides or chemicals. ### V7 Photocatalyst Mozzie Magnet is smokeless, odorless and is safe for use around human and pets. Now, protect your family from disease carrying mosquitoes with the V7 Photocatalyst Mozzie Magnet – A Scientifically proven mosquito control solution! ### Mosquitoes are attracted to human because of out body heat as well as the CO2that we exhale. ### Pest-stop® professional V7 photocatalyst Mozzie magnet can lure and capture the mosquitoes using an advance tripartite system. Heat, UV black light produced from the UVA lamp and CO2producedwhen ultraviolet rays are radiated onto the titanium dioxide (TIO2). ### Mosquitoes enter the trap through the rotate doors and the strong suction from the fan will draws them into the storage tray quickly. The funnel design suction path ensures that all insects will not be able to escape. Once they are in the storage tray, they cannot escape and will slowly die of dehydration. ### Thank you for choosing Boulevard Outdoor Inspirations by D’Galleria.

For the most accurate representation of the current batch, see image 2 (three tables with vases). ### Cast in concrete and polished to a smooth finish, this light grey side table maintains the earthiness of the raw material and, since it has been handcrafted, natural folds and markings can still be seen. The circular tabletop and simple round base are minimal in design, making it a great side table for the minimalist and industrial interior lover’s home. ### At 50cm high, this tall concrete table is the perfect base for your favourite table lamp, vase or art piece. Alternatively, it makes a great pedestal for serving drinks or nibbles when guests come over. Place in your lounge, hallway, kitchen, or patio for maximum functionality. ### Don't forget to style alongside our Hodi concrete coffee table and Hodi concrete plinth table, click ‘Show Other Options’ to view. ### Please note - due to the variable properties of cast concrete, colour variations and minor imperfections can occur. ### Diameter: 50cmHeight: 50cm ### Material: ConcreteFinish: Raw concrete ### For oversized or extremely fragile items, we use a specialist 2-man courier who takes greater care of our products.

This is the exact same formulation and product you have come to trust for over the years. The outstanding results are the same. The parent company has just decided to bring it under the Nordicare ""umbrella"" of items. ### An emulsified furniture oil for cleaning and care of oil finished wood surfaces such as teak, walnut and rosewood. Perfect for your Mid-Century furniture. The emulsion works to both clean and protect. Efficiently removes grease and finger marks. The furniture oil provides a long lasting oil impregnation of the wood, which protects the surface from drying out. The wood will attain a dull finish, underlining the natural colour and structure. Environmentally friendly with a child safe cap. Comes in a 250ML package. ### Additional of note: ### Directions:Simply apply with a soft dry cloth and rub until all dirt or grease spots disappear. If applied too thickly, excess oil may be wiped off after 60 minutes. Always test on an inconspicuous area before using on the visible surfaces.

https://vintagehomeboutique.ca/products/hand-made-cutting-boards,https://vintagehomeboutique.ca,Hand Made Cutting Boards ### Hand Made Cutting Boards,"FOLLOW US ### FOLLOW US ### Our locally made cutting boards are handmade from locally sourced black walnut, hard maple and dark cherry. We strive to bring quality, craftsmanship and engineering to all of our products, qualities that often seem overlooked in a lot of today’s products. ### Every component is made locally by an artisan carpenter. Kiln dried hardwood ensures that your cutting board will not warp bend or crack. Glued using VOC free, food grade, water safe glue and sanded to a smooth finish with multiple runs of increasingly fine sandpaper. With every cut we make, every hole we drill and every stroke of our brush, we have the end result in mind – always focusing on the best quality and most beautiful finished product for you and your family. Creating something that is beyond trend, an item which becomes a treasured family heirloom. ### The difference is the thickness: 1.5"". Others choose to cut a corner by using a thinner piece of wood. We choose the perfect proportion and weight. Our materials are carefully hand-picked, with each piece of wood selected for each unique cutting board. Finished with 3 hand applied coats of food safe mineral oil. Available in 2 sizes. Custom larger sizes can be quoted and accommodated. ### Dimensions: ### We ship accessories throughout Canada using a set rate by area via Canada Post.

Would really love to purchase. ### Thank you for shopping at Modishstore.The maximum wattage is 75 W for the light.Please inform if you need any other help ### Some of the photos make this look yellow-ish when lit. Others look almost pure white. Which is it? If it\'s yellow-ish, it won\'t go at all in the room where I\'d like to hang it, and I can\'t afford to send it back to CA. ### The Roost Lotus Flower Chandelier - White is not at all total pure white even when the light is off. It has sliver edges and the pedals do have a yellowish rustic look with lights on and off ### Can it be hung on a slanted ceiling? ### yes .. ### Is this dimmable? ### We do not give the dimmable option as it is all hardwired but we know that a lot of our customers have a dimmable switch ### I see that this fixture hangs from a cord length of 9' - 9-1/2'.

The quality of the chair is first class. My marvellous new chair arrived as scheduled, a wonderful addition.

I feel confident to buy from them again. Thank you for making it all so easy. ### I needed some 30s style and this hit the spot. My new sofas meant that my old table was too low.  This one is adjustable and itl ooks great.  Really pleased with the look and quality ### You delivered this table to thr wrong address. It was dumped outside the door of no.2 Barton Sq mews and the driver had disappeared without waiting for the householder to accept.He very kindly carried it round to me but was interrupted while working. NOT GOOD! ### We're sorry to hear that you had a delivery issue on this item. We booked delivery to the address on the order. As an independent business we rely on third party couriers to deliver smaller goods and once they are in transit, we are unable to control all aspects of specific deliveries. Our apologies again for any inconvenience caused and glad to hear that the driver brought it to you. ### All great. Many thanks ### I have waited so long for a piece of Eileen Gray in my house! Just love it, beautifully packed, easy to assemble and sat with the table having a coffee within 20 minutes of arrivel. ### Based in Sussex and established since 2014, Onske is an importer and retailer of high quality midcentury and Scandinavian style furniture. We supply to residential, commercial and hospitality clients throughout the UK. ### Classic Bahaus chair built to an excellent standard and very good value delivered earlier than advertised ### i had my floor lamp delivered without any fuss, the packing of the lamp was appropriate, very satisfied customer! ### I purchased the 110cm round white carrera marble/grey vein dining table approximately 5 months back. ### Due to it being a natural material, and not seeing the actual one that I was going to recieve, I was naturally a little hesitant  of how 'white' the marble was going to be and how 'dark' the grey veining was going to be, for the best contrast that I wanted.  (other than choosing a small slab and paying a fortune in a marble yard!) ### On the day of delivery I luckily had two other people in the property to help me move it from kerbside delivery into the house. ### On removing it 'well protected' packaging I was delighted to see the overall colouring and contrast of the white and grey marble of the dining table. It looks amazing in the kitchen with my new velvet dining chairs and overhead contemporary matt black single  tubular light fitting (that was chosen to simply highlight the reflective marble. I am both very happy with the finished product and the communication of the team when I wanted to make a colour change of the tulip base from white to black. ### Thank you for taking the time to review J. We really appreciate the feedback and comments :) and glad you are happy with your purchase. Our care guide here on best ways to protect and keep your marble table looking good may be of some use also :https://onske.co.uk/blogs/the-designer-furniture-style-blog/a-buyers-guide-to-tulip-style-tables ### Having deliberated for months i finally ordered the 170cm x 110 cm table, it looks amazing and is the perfect size. The marble is beautiful and having sealed it , i am thrilled. Onske were so helpful prior to delivery, delivery was quick and they removed my old stone table. The new table is very good value.

Share it with your friends so they can enjoy it too! ### We have had a number of hammocks and this one is by far the most comfortable and easy to use. It is strong and looks like it will last well for us. It has really made this spot in the garden, where it hangs.
Thanks so much to the Hammock Shop. ### This is such a lovely colour and its super comfortable and easy to use. Bring on those balmy summer days... ### The new hammock is up and already proofing to be a fave addition to our house. It’s been so nice to quietly swing in the breeze and while away the time doing not very much at all. The only downside is reading books is proofing difficult. I only seem to get through three to four pages before the hammock rocks me to sleep. ### The Hammock is fantastic - very very easy to get in and out of. Very easy & quick to assemble. Very Pleased ### Very quick to package and send off the hammock. Very please when we saw the quality of it, it was a spreader bar King. Looking forward to getting it hung and using it. 
Thanks ### Pros: Easy to order. Delivered quickly with updates tracking order progress. Seems like a high quality construction and finish. Very comfortable. Great fabric and colour. Cons: poor instructions, photocopied so many times it was too faint to make out images. No labels on parts so difficult to sort, bag of fixings had broken and scattered through the box. There appeared to be some items on the instructions that were missing but hard to read. ### About Us ### Delivery Information ### Frequently Asked Questions ### Testimonials ### Guarantee & Returns ### Terms & Conditions ### Privacy Policy ### Contact Us ### About our Hammocks ### Hammock Sizes ### Hammock Hanging ### Hammock Fabrics ### Hammock Care ### Hammock Lying Position ### Hammock Therapy ### Hammocks for Trees ### Hammocks for Good ### Hammock Reviews ### Stocked locally and delivered fast and free New Zealand wide. ### © 2024Hammock Shop."

You'll be hard-pressed to tell the difference between PolyTEAK and real wood. ### Very pleased with the quality, the style and the workmanship of these chairs. My husband has made wellover 125 Adirondack chairs, and these are as sturdy, good looking and comfortable. Most of all they will last muchlonger than a wooden chair.These chairs were made with stainless screws. A big positive! We ordered two black ones. ### We’ve had these adirondacks for almost two months now and so far I think they’re amazing. Great price, easy assembly, very sturdy, and I love that they’re all weather resistant. They look and feel like real wood but they’re not. My wide-hip husband find this seat to be very comfortable and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a spot to sit that you don’t have to store away every winter. ### We ordered two of these after much research. They were very easy to assemble, taking about 30 minutes for each chair, assembly was easy by just following from the pictures. The chairs are sturdy, not terribly heavy (if you want or need to move them) and are generally comfortable. For someone who is under 5""2"", if you sit all the way back, your feet may not quite touch the ground. For someone without a lot of ""junk in the trunk"" you may feel the seat after sitting a while. (Neither of these are considered criticisms of the design by us, just things for purchasers to consider.) Overall we are very happy with this purchase so far (after a week). ### I could not decide what kind of adirondack chairs to purchase due to the many options and colors. We wanted chairs that are durable, feel like wood, are comfortable and heavy so they don't tip over easy with the wind and have a not to traditional nor too modern feel. These chairs are a bit pricey but totally worth it and I am so happy with them. They meet all the criteria and originally I was going to purchase them in red but at the last minute I decided to purchase the grey color. They are neutral, go with everything, are quite heavy, confortable, stylish and blend well with my other outdoor furniture. If you are on the fence buy these you will not regret it. I am posting pictures in case it helps others. A picture another customer posted helped me with decision also. Don't hesitate these are great chairs. ### Your cart is empty ### Enable cookies to use the shopping cart ### Loading... ### $0.00 USD ### Loading... ### Taxes andshippingcalculated at checkout ### JOIN OUR MAILING LIST & NEVER MISS A DEAL. ### Santa Ana, California(949) 316-00109:00 AM-5:00 PM PSTsupport@polyteakoutdoor.com ### © 2024,PolyTEAK ### Powered by Shopify ### Are you 18 years old or older? ### Sorry, the content of this store can't be seen by a younger audience.

We design things that last and can be handed down from one generation to the next. The waste from fast-fashion-interiors is something we avoid.We recycle and reuse our packaging, our art is boxed in cartons that our cushions arrive in. We strive for a paperless office and any off-cut fabrics are recycled and re-used for things like gift cards and bags.We wish for our product that after it gives many generations joy and comfort that it gently returns to the earth with our love and gratitude. ### We support traditional artisans ### We have a strong focus on ethical labour. We work with our crafts people to stay in their local villages, ensuring they are not displaced for work. ### We believe that without the support, many ancient crafts will become extinct in the near future as generations move from craft based production into petro-chemical production. ### Thats why we are making it our mission to keep craftsmanship alive. ### We use upcycled and natural materials ### We incorporate sustainably sourced and upcycled elements in our designs, appreciating the beauty nature provides and ensuring we have a low impact on the environment. So, as you would find in nature, each piece is unique and no two are the same. ### 30 years experience! ### We are a small family business specialising in textile design since 1993. ### Customer service ### We are here to help!Contact usby phone or email. ### Secure payment ### Your payment information is processed securely. ### Yes, we ship all over the world, shipping costs are calculated at the checkout. ### In-stock orders usually ship within 1-3 business days.

While attending high school, he decided to create some amazing solid wood furniture pieces for his parents.Decades have passed and these same furniture pieces still stand today as they did when they were created back then. Styles have changed over the years, but the legacy and longevity of these beautiful pieces carries on.After successfully managing several furniture retail operations, Homestead Furniture Inc. was founded in 2003.We are dedicated to offering a wide variety of products manufactured with high quality control standards and joinery, while providing excellent customer service with very affordable pricing. ### Q. We have never purchased from your company. How do you compare to the most popular stores out there?A. We are better! Expect excellence when purchasing from us. We have been in business since 2003, providing exceptional quality products, pricing and customer service to clients locally, in BC, and right across Canada. ### Q. Do you stock any items that we can get delivered right away?A. Yes. We have our own large distribution warehouse, where we inventory many of our popular products, so they are readily available for same day pick up, or as soon as next day delivery. If you need products immediately, it is always best to email and check with us first to see which products are in stock and available.Q. I hate assembling furniture. How much assembly is required for your products?A. Very little, if any at all. Most of our products come fully factory assembled, including handles already installed. Common items that always require some assembly would be the bulky items such as dining tables and beds. However, our dining tables and beds, for the most part, require minimal assembly.Q. How does your quality of products compare to otherretailers, especially the big brand name stores?A. We are proud to offer you products that are manufactured exceptionally well. We would also like to state, that in general, you will find higher quality products, at lower prices, shopping with us as compared to all other retailers. We specialize in Canadian made upholstery and 100% solid wood furniture.Much of our wood products come fully factory assembled for structural strength and durability. These items have some of the finest joinery and construction methods you will find in the industry and are built to last for generations. Almost all of our dining chairs come fully factory assembled. This makes a very significant difference in overall quality.We do not sell many products that come KD (knock down) and do not sell any that require extensive time to assemble. MDF, Veneers, Panelboard, and Particleboard are words seldom, if ever, mentioned when speaking about our products.Our Canadian-made upholstery is manufactured to our high quality standards. This includes 100% solid wood frames, with the wood coming from Canadian mills. We also utilize strong no-sag seat springs, high density seat foam and high quality upholstery fabrics and stitching. ### Q. Are your 5-Star Google reviews all real?A. Yes, they are all from legitimate customers. We do not employ any marketing team to create and post fake 5-Star reviews for our business, elevating our Google review numbers into the hundreds or even thousands.Q. Why do you have a relatively small amount of Google reviews, while many other furniture retailers have several hundreds, even going into the thousands of reviews?A. Unfortunately, gravitating towards purchasing from a retailer with a high number of Google reviews and high overall rating fools many consumers. We do not use a marketing team to create fake 5-Star reviews in an effort to ""bury"" a high number of 1-Star reviews and boost our overall Google rating.A really simple way to get a better handle on any business is to read all the 1-Star Google reviews first, as they are very likely to be 100% authentic. Then you can make a much better judgement on the quality of products and level of customer service you will get. ### Q. Do you offer financing?A. Not at this time but please check back in the future. ### Q. Why do you suggest to email for all e-Com inquiries?A. Our team may not always be available to reply to questions over the phone, so we suggest email is the best way of communication to get the quickest replies 24/7.  Emails may also be responded to outside of business hours, where a phone call would not be answered.  We will try to respond within 1-2 days, but often within a hour or two.Q. Where is your showroom location?A. We are located at Unit #2115 - 575 Seaborne Avenue, Port Coquitlam, BC.Q. How far do you deliver to?A. We are currently able to promptly deliver throughout most of Western Canada. For anywhere outside of these areas, please email us your address with postal code, and the pieces you are interested in, and we will get back to you with a delivery quote as soon as possible. We can also make arrangements to deliver the goods to a storage depot in your area where you can pick up the items from.Q. Do you price match?A. Yes. We already offer the lowest prices guaranteed. We often check the competitors pricing to ensure you are getting the best price from us. If you find the exact same product for less elsewhere, please email us with the details and we will be happy to meet or beat the price.Q. I am really worried about purchasing anything online from any company, including furniture.  How will purchasing from your company be any different?A. You should feel very confident that the goods you are purchasing from us are all manufactured to the highest quality standards and represent some of the finest constructed furniture pieces you will ever own. We carry an extensive line up of 100% solid wood products. Our business is run professionally, efficiently, and with honesty and integrity. Our customer service is excellent. We do not try to pass off poor quality goods with a nice picture and description that makes it sound like an amazing item. We are confident that you will be pleasantly surprised with our product quality once you receive it.  If you are local to the showroom location, please stop in, where you can see many of our excellent quality products. Our Google reviews show the high level of satisfaction from just some of our happy customers.Upholstery Products:Q. If I place an order for custom upholstery, how long does it take to receive?A.Generally, please allow approximately8-12weeks for your custom order to be completed. Once your custom order is completed, we will contact you.Q. CanIget any upholstery order any faster?A. Yes. We often stock many upholstered goods in our local warehouse that can be delivered right away. In addition, at certain times we can get a rush order completed quicker. Please email us with the product and choice of fabric and we will try our best to get it out to you asap.  This option is not always available so it is best to place your order promptly. ### Q. Am I able to check on the product and fabric availability?A. Yes. Please email us with the product and choice of fabric and we will get back to you when we have that information.Q. Do you offer custom sizes?A. Yes. We offer many custom options to suit your configuration needs. Please send us dimensions and photos of your space so we can help optimize your space.Q. Are sofa-beds available?A. Yes. We can add sofa-beds to many of the sectionals, sofas, and loveseats. Please note that the seating area may feel firmer with the sofa bed option added.Q. Why are the seat cushions on my product firmer than the ones I tried out in the showroom?A.The seat cushions you may have tried in the showroom have been tested by other customers causing them to slightly soften. With time and usage of your furniture, your seat cushions will soften up slightly as well. Additionally, if a different fabric series was selected, the cushions may feel slightly firmer or softer. ### Q. How many items do you have in your showroom compared to online?A. We carry the most popular and available products on display in our showroom. If you would like to know if we carry a specific item, please email us before you make the trip so we can answer this for you.Q. Am I able to purchase extra yardage of fabric?A. Yes.Q. Am I able to supply my own fabric of my choosing and just send it to you guys?A. Yes. We highly recommend that you choose one of the 500 choices of high quality, designer fabrics that are available. Our manufacturers have chosen these fabrics carefully. These fabrics are very ""upholstery durable"" for every day use and have been chosen specifically to assure that the fabric you select will provide you with many years of use.Q. Am I able to get an update on my order?A. Product arrival dates and Custom order times may vary. Shipment ETA's are just that, estimated. We always follow up with the supply chain and track every pending order. Any delays always originate at the manufacturing, shipping and port, and are beyond our control. Once your custom order is in production, we usually cannot get an update until it is almost completed. When your products are ready for delivery or pick up, we will contact you. ### Q. Am I able to order any additional accent pillows to my order?A. Yes. ### Q. Am I able to order zippers on my accent pillows?A. Yes. You can add zippers to any toss pillow.Wood Care:Q. How do I take care of my wood furniture?A. Please follow the link below:https://homesteadfurniturebc.com/pages/general-wood-product-care ### Fabric Care:Q. How do I take care of my new upholstery?A. We suggest you flip or rotate your seat cushions at the beginning of each month. We also recommend that you vacuum your upholstery lightly with the right vacuum attachment about once a month.Q. How do I clean my new upholstery?A. To assure that your furniture lasts longer at a normal use we would suggest using a professional upholstery cleaner if you decide to clean your set. We offer an excelsior warranty program that includes a cleaning kit that should easily clean up any stains quickly.Q. Will sunlight affect my upholstery?A. Yes. Try to keep the sunlight away from your furniture so your fabrics will last much longer. Too much direct sunlight will fade the fabric and may make the fabric strength deteriorate due to the strength of the suns rays.Q. Can I wash my cushion covers?A. We recommend that you do not remove your cushion covers as it may be difficult to get them back onto the foam. We recommend using a professional upholstery cleaning service to clean your upholstered items.Q. Why is my fabric ""pilling"" Is this normal?A. Some fabrics may ""pill"" due to excessive fibre content on the surface of the fabric. Pilling does not compromise the quality of the fabric. This pilling can easily be trimmed off with a fabric shaver. The pilling will usually only occur after some use, and should eventually not happen with time, and after trimming the fibres with the fabric shaver 2-3 times.Leather:Q. Can I order a custom piece in leather?A. We don't offer any custom orders in leather at this time. ### No page specified.

Please note that the seating area may feel firmer with the sofa bed option added.Q. Why are the seat cushions on my product firmer than the ones I tried out in the showroom?A.The seat cushions you may have tried in the showroom have been tested by other customers causing them to slightly soften. With time and usage of your furniture, your seat cushions will soften up slightly as well. Additionally, if a different fabric series was selected, the cushions may feel slightly firmer or softer. ### Q. How many items do you have in your showroom compared to online?A. We carry the most popular and available products on display in our showroom. If you would like to know if we carry a specific item, please email us before you make the trip so we can answer this for you.Q. Am I able to purchase extra yardage of fabric?A. Yes.Q.

How do I take care of my wood furniture?A. Please follow the link below:https://homesteadfurniturebc.com/pages/general-wood-product-care ### Fabric Care:Q. How do I take care of my new upholstery?A. We suggest you flip or rotate your seat cushions at the beginning of each month. We also recommend that you vacuum your upholstery lightly with the right vacuum attachment about once a month.Q. How do I clean my new upholstery?A. To assure that your furniture lasts longer at a normal use we would suggest using a professional upholstery cleaner if you decide to clean your set. We offer an excelsior warranty program that includes a cleaning kit that should easily clean up any stains quickly.Q. Will sunlight affect my upholstery?A. Yes. Try to keep the sunlight away from your furniture so your fabrics will last much longer. Too much direct sunlight will fade the fabric and may make the fabric strength deteriorate due to the strength of the suns rays.Q. Can I wash my cushion covers?A. We recommend that you do not remove your cushion covers as it may be difficult to get them back onto the foam. We recommend using a professional upholstery cleaning service to clean your upholstered items.Q. Why is my fabric ""pilling"" Is this normal?A. Some fabrics may ""pill"" due to excessive fibre content on the surface of the fabric. Pilling does not compromise the quality of the fabric. This pilling can easily be trimmed off with a fabric shaver. The pilling will usually only occur after some use, and should eventually not happen with time, and after trimming the fibres with the fabric shaver 2-3 times.Leather:Q. Can I order a custom piece in leather?A. We don't offer any custom orders in leather at this time. ### No page specified.

Created from a jigsaw type construction made popular in 18th century Ireland, the collection is bench-built and hand-finished with up to 18 color applications to provide a genuine rustic charm.

While attending high school, he decided to create some amazing solid wood furniture pieces for his parents.Decades have passed and these same furniture pieces still stand today as they did when they were created back then. Styles have changed over the years, but the legacy and longevity of these beautiful pieces carries on.After successfully managing several furniture retail operations, Homestead Furniture Inc. was founded in 2003.We are dedicated to offering a wide variety of products manufactured with high quality control standards and joinery, while providing excellent customer service with very affordable pricing. ### Q. We have never purchased from your company. How do you compare to the most popular stores out there?A. We are better! Expect excellence when purchasing from us. We have been in business since 2003, providing exceptional quality products, pricing and customer service to clients locally, in BC, and right across Canada. ### Q. Do you stock any items that we can get delivered right away?A. Yes. We have our own large distribution warehouse, where we inventory many of our popular products, so they are readily available for same day pick up, or as soon as next day delivery. If you need products immediately, it is always best to email and check with us first to see which products are in stock and available.Q. I hate assembling furniture. How much assembly is required for your products?A. Very little, if any at all. Most of our products come fully factory assembled, including handles already installed. Common items that always require some assembly would be the bulky items such as dining tables and beds. However, our dining tables and beds, for the most part, require minimal assembly.Q. How does your quality of products compare to otherretailers, especially the big brand name stores?A. We are proud to offer you products that are manufactured exceptionally well. We would also like to state, that in general, you will find higher quality products, at lower prices, shopping with us as compared to all other retailers. We specialize in Canadian made upholstery and 100% solid wood furniture.Much of our wood products come fully factory assembled for structural strength and durability. These items have some of the finest joinery and construction methods you will find in the industry and are built to last for generations. Almost all of our dining chairs come fully factory assembled. This makes a very significant difference in overall quality.We do not sell many products that come KD (knock down) and do not sell any that require extensive time to assemble. MDF, Veneers, Panelboard, and Particleboard are words seldom, if ever, mentioned when speaking about our products.Our Canadian-made upholstery is manufactured to our high quality standards. This includes 100% solid wood frames, with the wood coming from Canadian mills. We also utilize strong no-sag seat springs, high density seat foam and high quality upholstery fabrics and stitching. ### Q. Are your 5-Star Google reviews all real?A. Yes, they are all from legitimate customers. We do not employ any marketing team to create and post fake 5-Star reviews for our business, elevating our Google review numbers into the hundreds or even thousands.Q. Why do you have a relatively small amount of Google reviews, while many other furniture retailers have several hundreds, even going into the thousands of reviews?A. Unfortunately, gravitating towards purchasing from a retailer with a high number of Google reviews and high overall rating fools many consumers. We do not use a marketing team to create fake 5-Star reviews in an effort to ""bury"" a high number of 1-Star reviews and boost our overall Google rating.A really simple way to get a better handle on any business is to read all the 1-Star Google reviews first, as they are very likely to be 100% authentic. Then you can make a much better judgement on the quality of products and level of customer service you will get. ### Q. Do you offer financing?A. Not at this time but please check back in the future. ### Q. Why do you suggest to email for all e-Com inquiries?A. Our team may not always be available to reply to questions over the phone, so we suggest email is the best way of communication to get the quickest replies 24/7.  Emails may also be responded to outside of business hours, where a phone call would not be answered.  We will try to respond within 1-2 days, but often within a hour or two.Q. Where is your showroom location?A. We are located at Unit #2115 - 575 Seaborne Avenue, Port Coquitlam, BC.Q. How far do you deliver to?A. We are currently able to promptly deliver throughout most of Western Canada. For anywhere outside of these areas, please email us your address with postal code, and the pieces you are interested in, and we will get back to you with a delivery quote as soon as possible. We can also make arrangements to deliver the goods to a storage depot in your area where you can pick up the items from.Q. Do you price match?A. Yes. We already offer the lowest prices guaranteed. We often check the competitors pricing to ensure you are getting the best price from us. If you find the exact same product for less elsewhere, please email us with the details and we will be happy to meet or beat the price.Q. I am really worried about purchasing anything online from any company, including furniture.  How will purchasing from your company be any different?A.

We specialize in Canadian made upholstery and 100% solid wood furniture.Much of our wood products come fully factory assembled for structural strength and durability. These items have some of the finest joinery and construction methods you will find in the industry and are built to last for generations. Almost all of our dining chairs come fully factory assembled. This makes a very significant difference in overall quality.We do not sell many products that come KD (knock down) and do not sell any that require extensive time to assemble.

This includes 100% solid wood frames, with the wood coming from Canadian mills. We also utilize strong no-sag seat springs, high density seat foam and high quality upholstery fabrics and stitching. ### Q. Are your 5-Star Google reviews all real?A. Yes, they are all from legitimate customers. We do not employ any marketing team to create and post fake 5-Star reviews for our business, elevating our Google review numbers into the hundreds or even thousands.Q. Why do you have a relatively small amount of Google reviews, while many other furniture retailers have several hundreds, even going into the thousands of reviews?A. Unfortunately, gravitating towards purchasing from a retailer with a high number of Google reviews and high overall rating fools many consumers. We do not use a marketing team to create fake 5-Star reviews in an effort to ""bury"" a high number of 1-Star reviews and boost our overall Google rating.A really simple way to get a better handle on any business is to read all the 1-Star Google reviews first, as they are very likely to be 100% authentic. Then you can make a much better judgement on the quality of products and level of customer service you will get. ### Q. Do you offer financing?A. Not at this time but please check back in the future. ### Q. Why do you suggest to email for all e-Com inquiries?A. Our team may not always be available to reply to questions over the phone, so we suggest email is the best way of communication to get the quickest replies 24/7.  Emails may also be responded to outside of business hours, where a phone call would not be answered.  We will try to respond within 1-2 days, but often within a hour or two.Q.

Please note that the seating area may feel firmer with the sofa bed option added.Q. Why are the seat cushions on my product firmer than the ones I tried out in the showroom?A.The seat cushions you may have tried in the showroom have been tested by other customers causing them to slightly soften. With time and usage of your furniture, your seat cushions will soften up slightly as well. Additionally, if a different fabric series was selected, the cushions may feel slightly firmer or softer. ### Q. How many items do you have in your showroom compared to online?A. We carry the most popular and available products on display in our showroom. If you would like to know if we carry a specific item, please email us before you make the trip so we can answer this for you.Q. Am I able to purchase extra yardage of fabric?A. Yes.Q.

How do I take care of my wood furniture?A. Please follow the link below:https://homesteadfurniturebc.com/pages/general-wood-product-care ### Fabric Care:Q. How do I take care of my new upholstery?A. We suggest you flip or rotate your seat cushions at the beginning of each month. We also recommend that you vacuum your upholstery lightly with the right vacuum attachment about once a month.Q. How do I clean my new upholstery?A. To assure that your furniture lasts longer at a normal use we would suggest using a professional upholstery cleaner if you decide to clean your set. We offer an excelsior warranty program that includes a cleaning kit that should easily clean up any stains quickly.Q. Will sunlight affect my upholstery?A. Yes. Try to keep the sunlight away from your furniture so your fabrics will last much longer. Too much direct sunlight will fade the fabric and may make the fabric strength deteriorate due to the strength of the suns rays.Q. Can I wash my cushion covers?A. We recommend that you do not remove your cushion covers as it may be difficult to get them back onto the foam. We recommend using a professional upholstery cleaning service to clean your upholstered items.Q. Why is my fabric ""pilling"" Is this normal?A. Some fabrics may ""pill"" due to excessive fibre content on the surface of the fabric. Pilling does not compromise the quality of the fabric. This pilling can easily be trimmed off with a fabric shaver. The pilling will usually only occur after some use, and should eventually not happen with time, and after trimming the fibres with the fabric shaver 2-3 times.Leather:Q. Can I order a custom piece in leather?A. We don't offer any custom orders in leather at this time. ### No page specified.

While attending high school, he decided to create some amazing solid wood furniture pieces for his parents.Decades have passed and these same furniture pieces still stand today as they did when they were created back then. Styles have changed over the years, but the legacy and longevity of these beautiful pieces carries on.After successfully managing several furniture retail operations, Homestead Furniture Inc. was founded in 2003.We are dedicated to offering a wide variety of products manufactured with high quality control standards and joinery, while providing excellent customer service with very affordable pricing. ### Q.
