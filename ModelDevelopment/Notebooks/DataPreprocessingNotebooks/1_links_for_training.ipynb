    "# Web scraping all the sitemaps found from the CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook aims to search all the webpages inside `furniture stores pages.csv` for sitemaps, store them and get as many pages from each sitemap found.\n",
    "- I find this method to work best in terms of gathering a lot of training data fast. Sitemaps are predictable and easier to scrape in contrast to going through all the `a` tags from each website manually. The only downside to this method is that you lose some diversity in your data (due to losing the websites that don't contain a sitemap or have an inaccessible sitemap), but the number of training entries gathered from the websites that do have a sitemap more than offset for this loss."

    "- The methods below are meant to search any links from sitemaps that contain the paths '/products/' or '/collections/'. It will also catch other sitemaps from inside the sitemaps so that it can recursively get as many links as possible.\n",
    "- Because the algorithm would probably take days to finish if I dont cut it short manually, I will only let it run until it gets most of the links.\n",
    "- From testing once it gets at just about 300000 links it starts to slow down significantly to the point that there are no new links to be found.\n",
    "- By looking at more sitemaps you can probably get more sitemap paths / product paths that lead to good results (apart from sitemap_products_1.xml), but that would require a lot of time. The code can be scaled to fit such needs."
