# Furniture stores extraction of products
Currently a work in progress... the goal of this project is to create an app that allows users to input any website link. The app will output a list of all furniture products found on the website (if any), presented in various formats, including product images and prices. The backend will be powered by a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, specifically a fine-tuned BERT-like model.
All the notebooks will be properly documented, and redundant CSV files will be removed once the project is complete.
