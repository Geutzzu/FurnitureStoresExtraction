# Furniture stores extraction of products
Currently work in progress... The goal of this project is to create an app that allows users to input any website link. The app will output a list of all furniture products found on the website (if any), presented in various formats, including product images and prices. The backend will be powered by a fine-tuned BERT-like model.
